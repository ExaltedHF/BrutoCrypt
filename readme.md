# Bruto Crypt
Oldschool-style crypter with flashy graphics. Used to run a .NET executable in memory through a C++ stub.

# Notes
Doesn't actually encrypt your .NET executable yet, just puts it raw in native resources of the stub.

# Usage
* Compile the C++ stub
* Compile the C# Crypter
* Copy InstallUtil.exe (stub) to a folder with the crypter bin called Stub/InstallUtil.exe
* Start the crypter
* Crypt any .NET executable
